### Assignment 2) Complete the Python tutorial on the Software Carpentry website:

If you are not yet familiar with the basics of Python, begin on the following website, and begin your
journey in the amazing, scary, and powerful world of python. This website allows you learn the basics
of python from a web-based version of python, so you can begin this even before you have python installed
on your computer. We prefer that you run the commands on your own computer but this is a very good way to
get started.
